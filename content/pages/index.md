title: "From SaaS Builder to Template Creator"
story: "<p>After 6 years building SaaS products, I got tired of recreating the same personal brand architectures. Every project needed the same foundation: <strong>content management, SEO optimization, performance tuning</strong>.</p><p>So I built Nuxt Launch Kit - an opinionated template that handles all the boring decisions. Now I focus on what matters: <strong>building businesses and helping others do the same</strong>.</p><p>This site was built in 24 hours using the template. The same template you can download below.</p>"
