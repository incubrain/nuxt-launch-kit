## Technical Implementation

Our carousel component is built on modern web technologies:

- **Variant-based styling**: Simplifies configuration with opinionated presets.
- **TypeScript interfaces**: Ensures type safety across all props.
- **Vue 3 Composition API**: Provides optimal reactivity and performance.
- **SSR compatibility**: Supports server-side rendering for SEO.

```typescript
const variantConfigs = {
  gallery: {
    ui: { /* optimized gallery styling */ },
    autoplay: { delay: 4000 },
    orientation: 'horizontal',
    align: 'center'
  },
  hero: {
    ui: { /* dramatic showcase styling */ },
    autoplay: { delay: 6000 },
    orientation: 'horizontal',
    align: 'center'
  }
}
```
